                <p>I will ensure that a secure internet connection is used at my telework location at my telework location, and that to reduce risk of a cybersecurity breach, unsecure publicly available internet connections will not be used.</p>

                <h4 class="ui dividing header">Employee Responsibilities for telework</h4>
                <p>I recognize that the Crown will not be held liable for an employee’s negligent misuse of government equipment that results in damages to the employee’s personal or real property during the performance of official duties or while using government equipment at the employee’s telework location.</p>
                <p>I have completed or will complete the TC-required OHS training. I commit to maintaining a safe personal telework workspace. I recognize that my employer is responsible for my telework work tasks only, not for my entire home. I agree to report to my supervisor any accident, injury, illness, discomfort, ergonomic issues and hazards as soon as possible. Any accident, injury or illness arising from teleworking will only be considered work-related if arising from the performance of my work-related duties.</p>
                <p>Transport Canada reserves the right to inspect the telework location I have identified. I recognize that in the event of a workplace accident, I may be required to allow access to investigators to perform their duties and recommend the appropriate corrective action and non-cooperation may impact my WAA.</p>
                <p>Note : If you have any questions regarding the above conditions, contact your manager or Regional OHS Advisor, where applicable.</p>
                
                <h4 class="ui dividing header">General conditions</h4>

                    <li>Understanding that any access to TC's network outside of Canada is prohibited, either through TC-issued or personal devices unless approved by the Deputy Minister.
